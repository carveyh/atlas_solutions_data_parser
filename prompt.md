Solve the programming test below using Ruby language –

You can use any tool or library to do your program (rather than doing everything from scratch).

Make sure to avoid having any hard coded data from these specific files – i.e. your program should work with any similar data file.

VERY IMPORTANT:    DO NOT USE ANY AI GENERATED CODE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.


PROGRAMMING TEST
====================
Please use the attached two documents along with the instructions given to write your program

Preferably in RUBY and use any tools you wish to choose. Do not limit yourself to any time limit,

but try to do an error free code.

---

The candidate should preferably use Ruby programming language and any tools they like. Ideally, they should create a small github repo for their solution and share it with me.

Developer Challenge
====================
In the attached file (w_data.dat), you’ll find daily weather data. Download this text file, then write a Ruby program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).

The attached soccer.dat file contains the results from the English Premier League. The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.
